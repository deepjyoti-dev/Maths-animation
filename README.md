# 🎨 Maths Visualizer in C Graphics

A C graphics project that visually represents key mathematical concepts — **Circle, Coordinate Geometry, Mensuration, Quadratic Equations, and Trigonometric Functions** — using the classic **BGI graphics library (`graphics.h`)**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Maths Visualizer** is designed to help students understand mathematics through **visual learning**.  
It transforms core equations and formulas into graphical representations — combining **programming, geometry, and visualization**.

This project is ideal for beginners learning:
- C programming
- Computer graphics
- Coordinate geometry
- Mathematical visualization

## 🧮 Topics Covered

### 🟢 Circle
- **Equation:** `x² + y² = r²`
- Draws a circle using radius and center coordinates.
- Shows how each point on the circle is equidistant from the center.

### 🔵 Coordinate Geometry
- Visualizes line equations, distance, midpoint, and slope.
- Demonstrates how coordinates relate to geometric positions.

### 🟣 Mensuration
- Draws basic shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle).
- Calculates and displays **area** and **perimeter** formulas.
- Great for understanding geometry used in measurements.

### 🟠 Quadratic Equation
- **Equation:** `y = ax² + bx + c`
- Plots a **parabola** based on user input for coefficients.
- Shows how coefficients affect the curve’s shape.

### 🔴 Trigonometry
- **Equations:** `y = sin(x)`, `y = cos(x)`, `y = tan(x)`
- Plots trigonometric waves with clear periodic patterns.
- Helps visualize amplitude, wavelength, and periodicity.
